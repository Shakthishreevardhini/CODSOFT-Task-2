TASK 2 : PASSWORD GENERATOR


OVERVIEW:The objective of the Password Generator program is to provide a secure and user-friendly tool for generating strong and customizable passwords. It allows users to specify the desired password length and ensures the inclusion of a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, making the generated password robust against brute force or guessing attacks. With a clean graphical user interface (GUI), users can easily generate passwords, copy them to the clipboard for convenient use, and clear the output field when needed. This tool is ideal for improving online security by encouraging the use of strong, unique passwords for various applications and accounts.
